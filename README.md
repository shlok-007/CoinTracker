  1. *Arduino UNO with Connection cable.
  2. *ESP8266 module
  3. *Color LCD TFT Display
  4. Breadboard
  5. Male2Male Jumper Wires
  6. Male2Female Jumper Wires
  7. Female2Female Jumper Wires
The components marked with ‘*’ were mandatory to use in the development.
  
 Following are the libraries used in the development:
  1. Wire.h
  2. Adafruit_GFX.h
  3. TFT_ILI9163C.h
  4. ESP8266WiFi.h
  5. WiFiClientSecure.h
  6. ESP8266HTTPClient.h
  7. Arduino_Json.h
  
Implementation:
